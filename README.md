# open-management-portal-git-api project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.
If you want to learn more about Quarkus, please visit its website: https://quarkus.io/ .

## Running the application

Prior to running the app, you need to create a **Personal Access Token** linked to your GitLab account.

You could edit your bash profile and make your Quarkus quacky by adding this neat emoji alias, then all you need to fire up your  app is run ðŸ¦†
```
echo "alias ðŸ¦†='./mvnw quarkus:dev -Dquarkus.http.port=8080'" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc

ðŸ¦†
```

### Running with a profile 

You can run your application using Quarkus profiles using:
```
export CONFIG_REPOSITORY_ID =<Git Repo id where the config files are>
export GITLAB_API_URL=<The base url of your git api. ie https://gitlab.com>
export GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<GitLab Personal Access Token>
export OMP_LOGGING=DEBUG
export RESIDENCIES_PARENT_REPOSITORIES_ID=<Parent project id where repos will be saved>
export TEMPLATE_REPOSITORY_ID=<Repo where template live>
export QUARKUS_PROFILE=<Quarkus profile>
./mvnw clean package
java -jar target/open-management-portal-git-api-*-runner.jar
```

## Packaging and running the application

The application is packageable using `./mvnw package`.
It produces the executable `open-management-portal-git-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar` file in `/target` directory.
Be aware that itâ€™s not an _Ã¼ber-jar_ as the dependencies are copied into the `target/lib` directory.

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/open-management-portal-git-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative`.

Or you can use Podman to build the native executable using: `./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-runtime=podman`.

You can then execute your binary: `./target/open-management-portal-git-api-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/building-native-image-guide .


## Configuration

The preferred place to store non-sensitive data is in the application.properties.

Sensitive fields like the gitlab token and cluster credentials should be stored in a OpenShift secret at a minimum. Other environment specific information should be stored in environmental variables such as repository id for residencies and repository id for the config.

Deployment template will read from the above secret and inject following env variables. These are controlled from application.properties, so if a different env name is needed, change in the application properties file and the deployment template.

* `TEMPLATE_REPOSITORY_ID`
* `RESIDENCIES_PARENT_REPOSITORIES_ID`
* `GITLAB_API_URL`
* `GITLAB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (should be secret and a service account)
